# 🔵 AIDD 30-Day Challenge — Task 3  🔵 
### by **Syeda Farheen Zehra**


## 🌟 Part A — Research Questions (Short Answers)

### 1. What new improvements were introduced in Gemini 3.0?
- Gemini 3.0 introduces a new **Deep Think mode**, enabling stronger logical reasoning and problem-solving.
- It offers a massive **1 million-token context window**, allowing long and complex prompts to be processed effectively.
- Multimodal capabilities have been significantly improved, enabling native understanding of **text, images, audio, and video**.
- A new **Generative Interface System** (Visual Layout & Dynamic View) creates richer, more interactive responses.

### 2. How does Gemini 3.0 improve coding & automation workflows?
- Gemini 3.0 supports **agentic coding**, enabling AI agents to write code, run terminal commands, and interact with the browser.
- Introduces **Antigravity**, an agent-first development environment where AI collaborates on tasks, planning, and execution.
- Gemini CLI and API enable developers to automate full development workflows using natural-language instructions.
- “**Vibe coding**” lets developers describe an idea in plain language, and Gemini converts it into interactive UI components or apps.

### 3. How does Gemini 3.0 improve multimodal understanding?
- Gemini 3.0 is trained with deeply integrated multimodal data, improving cross-modal reasoning across text, images, audio, and video.
- Enhanced **visual reasoning** allows understanding of documents, diagrams, and scenes beyond simple OCR.
- **Spatial reasoning** improvements enable better understanding of layouts, movement, and object relationships.
- Stronger **video reasoning** helps process long videos with detailed context retention.

### 4. Name any two developer tools introduced with Gemini 3.0.
- **Google Antigravity** — An agentic development platform where Gemini agents can operate code, terminal, and browser tools.
- **Gemini CLI** — A command-line interface allowing developers to run Gemini 3.0 for coding, automation, project generation, and workflows.
